## üìñ About The Project

This is a robust RESTful API developed as the backend for a **GymPass-style application**. The project was built following **SOLID** design principles and **Clean Architecture**, ensuring clean, scalable, and easily maintainable code.

The application allows users to register, find gyms, perform check-ins, and more, featuring a role-based access control system (Member vs. Admin).

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Authentication & Profile:** User registration and login with JWT authentication, as well as profile viewing.
- **Gym Management:** Registration of new gyms (restricted to administrators).
- **Gym Search:** Search for gyms by name or proximity (within a 10km radius).
- **Check-in System:** Users can check into nearby gyms.
- **Check-in Validation:** Administrators can validate user check-ins within 20 minutes of their creation.
- **History & Metrics:** Users can view their check-in history and metrics.

---

## üöÄ Key Concepts Implemented

In addition to its features, the project implements industry-standard patterns to ensure security and a great user experience.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Access control is based on user roles (`Role`). There are two access levels:
- `MEMBER`: Standard user, can search for gyms and perform check-ins.
- `ADMIN`: User with elevated privileges, can register gyms and validate check-ins.

This is implemented via middleware that verifies the user's role on specific routes, such as `POST /gyms` and `PATCH /check-ins/:checkInId/validate`.

### Refresh Token

To enhance security and user experience, the API uses a **Refresh Token** system:
1.  Upon authenticating, the user receives a short-lived `token` and a `refreshToken`.
2.  The `token` is used to access protected routes.
3.  When the `token` expires, instead of forcing a new login, the client application can use the `refreshToken` (which is stored securely, e.g., in an HTTP Only cookie) to request a new access token via the `PATCH /token/refresh` route.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the project running locally.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 20 or higher)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and Docker Compose
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git)
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    - Create a copy of the example file `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`.
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```
    - Fill in the variables in the `.env` file. For the Docker environment, the default values should work.
      ```env
      # .env
      DATABASE_URL="postgresql://docker:docker@db:5432/apisolid?schema=public"
      JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret-here"
      PORT=3333
      ```

4.  **Start the environment with Docker:**
    - This command will build the image, start the API and database containers, run migrations, and seed the database with initial data.
    ```bash
    npm run docker:dev
    ```

üéâ The API will be running at `http://localhost:3333`.

## üß™ Testing the API (with Insomnia/Postman)

With the application running, you can now test the routes.

### Step 1: Create a User and Authenticate

1.  **Create a new user (MEMBER):**
    - `POST` `http://localhost:3333/users`
    - Body (JSON):
      ```json
      {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com",
        "password": "password123"
      }
      ```

2.  **Authenticate:**
    - `POST` `http://localhost:3333/sessions`
    - Body (JSON):
      ```json
      {
        "email": "john.doe@example.com",
        "password": "password123"
      }
      ```
    - **Save the `token`** returned in the response. You will also receive a `refreshToken` in the response cookies.

### Step 2: Accessing Protected Routes

For any other route that requires authentication, you must send the token in the request header.

- **Header:** `Authorization`
- **Value:** `Bearer <PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>`

1.  **Example: View your profile:**
    - `GET` `http://localhost:3333/me`
    - Add the `Authorization` Header as described above.
    - You will receive your profile data in the response.

### Step 3: Accessing Admin Routes

The `seed` script that runs with `docker:dev` already creates an **ADMIN** user.

- **Email:** `andre@andre.com`
- **Password:** `123456`

1.  **Authenticate as an Admin:**
    - `POST` `http://localhost:3333/sessions`
    - Body (JSON):
      ```json
      {
        "email": "andre@andre.com",
        "password": "123456"
      }
      ```
    - Save the new admin `token`.

2.  **Example: Register a new gym (Admin Route):**
    - `POST` `http://localhost:3333/gyms`
    - Add the **Admin token** to the `Authorization` Header.
    - Body (JSON):
      ```json
      {
        "title": "Code Gym",
        "description": "The best gym for devs",
        "phone": "11999999999",
        "latitude": -23.563853,
        "longitude": -46.656507
      }
      ```
    - The gym will be created successfully. If you try this with a `MEMBER` user's token, you will receive an unauthorized error.

### Step 4: Refreshing the Access Token

When your main token expires, use the refresh route. Insomnia/Postman handles cookies automatically, so you just need to make the request.

- `PATCH` `http://localhost:3333/token/refresh`
- This request does not need a body or an `Authorization` header.
- The response will contain a new, valid `token`.

## üìú Available Scripts

- `npm run start:dev`: Starts the application in development mode with hot-reload.
- `npm run build`: Compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript.
- `npm run test`: Runs unit tests.
- `npm run test:e2e`: Runs End-to-End tests (requires a test database).
- `npm run docker:dev`: Starts the complete environment (API + Database) with Docker.
- `npm run docker:down`: Stops and removes the Docker containers and volumes.

---

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and testing.

1.  **Trigger:** The workflows are triggered on every `pull_request` opened against the `master` branch.
2.  **Workflows:**
    - **Unit Tests:** A fast job that installs dependencies and runs `npm run test`. It ensures that the core business logic is correct.
    - **E2E Tests:** A more comprehensive job that spins up a temporary PostgreSQL service container, installs dependencies, and runs `npm run test:e2e`. It guarantees that the integration between the API and the database is working perfectly.

This automation ensures that new code is only merged into the main branch if it passes all tests, maintaining the project's quality and stability.
